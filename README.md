# docker-mongo-quick-start

Create yourself a damn good single node MongoDB service in no time.

No wasting life on building.

The mongodb service is a single node replica set.

# Requirements
* docker

# Setup
1. Modify the volumes to your own storage path.
For those who using VM: Do Not use a mount path 

2. Do the bash
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

CAUTION: DO NOT explore your service on internet WITHOUT authentication!
